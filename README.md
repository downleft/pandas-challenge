# Pandas Challenge
Module 4 Challenge - Use data and starter code provided within course curriculum to analyze school performance within a hypothetical school district to assist city leadership with making strategic decisions for budgeting and priorities.

## Running the Code
The file to use for analyzing the data is within the PyCitySchools folder, entitled PyCitySchools_Analysis.ipynb . 
This file was put together and runs using Jupyter Notebook.

Within the Resources folder, there are two csv files: schools_complete.csv and students_complete.csv

## Applications of the code
The PyCitySchools_Analysis.ipynb is set up to do the following:
- Read preexisting csv files and merge the information into a single dataframe
- Calculate overall metrics regarding student counts, budgeting, and testing data
- Calculate school-specific metrics regarding student counts, budgeting, testing data, and school type
- Compare schools based on pass rates, school type, school size, and per capita spending√ü
